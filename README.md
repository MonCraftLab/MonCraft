## Overview

**Digitama** brings the evolution concept of classic digital creatures on-chain.

The project consists of a single on-chain organism with its own wallet.  
It participates in real crypto markets using creator fees as its only source of energy.

There is no user control and no predefined path.  
Its evolution is determined entirely by its trading behavior — how it takes risk, how it manages positions, and how it survives market volatility.

---

## How It Works

- One autonomous on-chain entity  
- One independent wallet  
- Funded exclusively by creator fees  
- Real trades executed on-chain  
- No external deposits or manual intervention  

Every trade leaves a trace.  
Every decision affects its state.

---

## Evolution

There are no levels, feeding mechanics, or upgrade systems.

Evolution is not a reward.  
It is the natural outcome of accumulated behavior over time.

The organism may:
- Grow
- Regress
- Mutate
- Or die

There are no resets.

---

## Rules

```
[ RULES ]
1. There is only one Digitama. No resets.
2. The market decides. No one else does.
3. Creator fees are fuel, not protection.
4. Evolution reflects behavior, not success.
5. Failure is allowed. Observation continues.
