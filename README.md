## What is Pin.Fun?

Pin.Fun is an on-chain narrative system built on Solana. It introduces a simple but extreme rule: at any given moment, only one narrative can exist. This unique Pin slot is globally visible, permanently recorded on-chain, and immutable, defining what collective attention acknowledges and remembers.

In a world of infinite tokens and stories, attention is scarce. Pin.Fun does not create more narratives; it constrains them through absolute scarcity. The Pin is not owned forever, but earned through ongoing contention shaped by participation, time, and consensus. Pin.Fun is not about hype, but about establishing a new on-chain primitive for deciding what deserves to be remembered.

## Workflow

**1️⃣ Forge Pin (PinRite)**  
Users can inject $PIN or participate through actions to forge a Pin core.  
- Each forging modifies the Pin’s attributes: scarcity, duration, influence  
- No asset burning is required; cost is expressed as time, attention, and participation  

**2️⃣ Stake Enhancement (PinStake)**  
Users can stake $PIN to strengthen the forged Pin, increasing its weight and duration.  
- Longer staking → rarer and stronger Pin attributes  
- Staking is reversible; the protocol handles long-term supply adjustments  

**3️⃣ AI Empowerment (spl.PIN)**  
AI automatically generates each Pin’s unique narrative and on-chain attributes, creating a native spl.PIN asset  
- Each Pin is unique and can be traded or collected on-chain  
- Records origin, influence, duration, and historical context  
- Not an NFT image, but a native on-chain narrative entity  

**4️⃣ Contention & Upgrade (Pin Slot)**  
There is only one Pin slot globally  
- To acquire the Pin → requires forging + staking + strategic actions  
- Pin holders → can upgrade, extend duration, and influence the narrative  
- New narratives can challenge at any time; AI and on-chain rules determine replacements  

**One-line summary of the workflow:**  
Forge → Stake → AI Empowerment → Pin Slot Contention → Upgrade/Extension → On-chain History

## Key Features

- **Extreme Scarcity:** Only one narrative can occupy the Pin slot at any given time  
- **On-Chain Visibility:** All actions are recorded transparently on Solana  
- **AI-Powered Narrative:** Each Pin is enriched by AI to define its historical context and impact  
- **Community Driven:** Participation, attention, and consensus determine who controls the Pin  
- **Native Asset:** spl.PIN is a unique on-chain entity, not a traditional NFT

## Summary

Pin.Fun is a new Solana primitive that allows the world to pin exactly one narrative at a time. It transforms attention, participation, and AI evaluation into a measurable, tradable, and historically recorded on-chain asset. The project is not about memes or short-term hype—it is about creating a new standard for how stories, ideas, and events are recorded and remembered on-chain.
